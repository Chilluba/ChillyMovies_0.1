 Prompt to Guide UI Enhancement for ChillyMovies
Iâ€™m building a desktop application called ChillyMovies. Its core features include:

ðŸŽ¬ Movie Downloads with search, metadata display, and quality selection.

ðŸ“º TV Series Downloads, where users can download:

Single episodes

Full seasons

All available seasons

ðŸŽ¥ YouTube Video Downloads by pasting a URL:

Choose quality (e.g., 720p, 1080p)

Option to download audio-only

The app is built using Electron, React, and TailwindCSS for a modern desktop UI. It uses the TMDB API for movie/TV metadata.

I already have a basic UI layout template, but I want your help to guide me on enhancing the user interface. I donâ€™t want code. I want a set of UI/UX guidelines and suggestions that I (or an AI agent) can follow consistently throughout development.

Please provide:

Recommended UI libraries, design systems, or frameworks that fit a modern, minimalistic, and clean desktop app.

Best practices for component styling, spacing, typography, layout, and responsiveness, especially for a desktop-first experience.

Suggestions on dark/light mode implementation, font choices, and icon systems.

Tools or utilities to ensure consistent design across all components and pages.

Guidelines to make the app feel professional, intuitive, and smooth, especially when dealing with search, modals, download options, and long content lists (e.g., series episodes).

Please align all suggestions with the intended feel of ChillyMovies: minimal, elegant, efficient, and user-friendly for anyone who just wants to search, preview, and download content easily.
